The GM determines its placement within the scene and the nature of any clues.",

Examples include hiding spots, cover, distractions, shelter, or exploitable elements such as a ladder or window.",
      "Define a Relationship: You may introduce a new, plausible relationship between your character and an existing NPC. This should be a loose/minor connection rather than a close/serious tie. For example, you may have a common friend, shared history, or old but mild rivalry. You may define the rough basics, but the GM determines the finer points and the NPC’s attitude towards your character."
