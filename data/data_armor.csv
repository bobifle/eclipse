"Armor","Armor","Armor Vest ","EP","312","Armor vests provide more thorough protection to a body’s vital areas, covering the abdomen and torso completely, protecting the neck with a rigid collar, and even providing wrap-under protection for the groin.

"Armor","Armor","Battlesuit Powered Exoskeleton","EP","344","The battlesuit powered exoskeleton features a military-grade fullerene armor shell with flexible aerogel for thermal insulation and a diamond-hardened exterior designed to resist even potent ballistic and energy-based weapons. The suit also enhances the wearer’s strength and mobility, applying a +10 bonus to strength-based tests, inflicting an extra +1d10 damage and AP of –2 on melee attacks, and doubling the distance by which the character may jump. Battlesuits are completely sealed to protect the wearer from environmental factors and temperatures from –175 to 140 C. Battlesuit helmets are equipped with an ecto (p. 325), a radio booster (p. 314), and sensors equal to specs (p. 326). They are fitted with life support features and a maker (p. 328) capable of recycling all wastes and producing air for up to 48 hours and food and water indefinitely. These suits have an Armor Value of 21/21. Occupants may only wear armor with an Armor rating (Energy or Kinetic) of 4 or less; this worn armor is cumulative without layering penalties.

"Armor","Implant","Bioweave Armor (Heavy) ","EP","302","Heavy bioweave armor involves lacing the morph’s skin with a denser and thicker network of the same fibers. The morph’s skin becomes thicker and somewhat less flexible except at the joints. The morph’s skin also has an unusually smooth look, and a distinctively smooth and tough-feeling texture. This provides an Armor rating of 3/4 without decreasing the morph’s mobility. The character’s sense of touch, however, is significantly reduced (–20 modifier) except on their hands, feet, and face. This armor is cumulative with worn armor. ",,"Moderate","3","4",,,

Spray armor does not work on synthetic morphs or on clothing or other armor. The color and feel of the armor can be adjusted with electric currents and additional polymers, making it popular among some socialite and nightlife scenes.
