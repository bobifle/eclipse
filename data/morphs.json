Their toes are also more articulated and now accompa- nied with an opposable thumb. Neo-avians have adapted well to microgravity environ- ments, and are favored for their small size and reduced resource use."

They retain eight arms, their chameleon ability to change skin color, ink sacs, and a sharp beak. They also have increased brain mass and longevity, can breathe both air and water, and lack a skeletal structure so they can squeeze through tight spaces. Octomorphs typically crawl along in zero gravity using their arm suckers and expelling air for propulsion; in low gravity they walk on two of their arms. Their eyes have been enhanced with color vision, provide a 360-degree field of vision, and rotationally adjust to keep the slit-shaped pupil aligned with “up.” A transgenic vocal system allows them to speak."

Four legs/manipulating arms and four weapon pods are folded inside its frame. It uses vector-thrust nozzles to maneuver in microgravity and also takes advantage of an ionic drive for fast movement over distance. Reapers are infamous due to military sims and Fall XPs; bringing one into most habitats will undoubtedly raise eyebrows if not get you arrested."
