    "text": "<p>The transhuman desire to enhance the body and mind melds neatly with our species' history of recreational substance abuse. Drugs of all kinds — chemical, nano, or electronic — are not only popular but widespread. Advances in biotechnology have eliminated many of the side effects, but transhuman bodies are complicated environments, so they remain a factor, especially with long-term use.</p><p> Drugs are available in a variety of forms: pills, slap patches, inhalers, disposable injectors, liquids, powders, etc. The drugs here are just a representative sampling. There are thousands if not millions of drugs in circulation in Eclipse Phase — GMs are encouraged to introduce their own, using these as guidelines.</p><p> Note that some drugs may have different effects on morphs with the Non-Human Biochemistry trait (GM discretion).</p><p> <b>Complexity:</b> The listed Complexity is for 5 doses/applications of the chemical, drug, or toxin.</p> <h3>Drug and Toxin Rules</h3> <p>Every substance has a type (determining what it can affect), an application method (how it is deployed), and an effect (what it does).</p> <h4>Types</h4> There are three classifications: <ul> <li>Biochem: These are natural biological substances and compounds produced by chemical synthesis, nanofab, or enzymatic biosynthesis. Biochem drugs and toxins only affect biomorphs.</li> <li>Nano: Nanodrugs and -toxins are temporary nanobot colonies designed to operate within biological hosts and programmed to create a certain effect. Nanodrugs and -toxins only affect biomorphs.</li> <li>Electronic: These reproduce drug-like effects for infomorphs and egos residing in cyberbrains. E-drugs are sold on the black market as single-use or self-erasing downloads, just like blueprints.</li> </ul> <h4>Application Methods</h4> <p>The application method determines how quickly the substance is absorbed into the body, as noted on the Onset Times table. An onset time of immediate means the effect kicks in at the end of an action turn, an onset time of 1 action turn kicks in at the end of the next turn.</p> <ul> <li>App: Electronic substances are run like other software.</li> <li>Dermal (D): This drug/toxin is absorbed via the skin as either a gas, liquid, or solid (e.g., paste). Slap patches or splash weapons are commonly used, loaded with the chemical DMSO, which transfers the drug through the skin. Slap patches can be applied to others in melee combat with a touch-only (+20) attack. Melee weapons may also be coated (Coated Weapons ▶219).</li> <li>Inhalation (Inh): This is a gas that is breathed into the lungs or snorted nasally. Used for inhalers, aerosols, powders, and gas grenades/seekers.</li> <li>Injected (Inj): This liquid is applied via either an intramuscular or intravenous injection. Used for needles and piercing weapons (Coated Weapons ▶219).</li> <li>Oral (O): This is a liquid or solid that is absorbed through the stomach or oral cavity (eating or drinking). Used with pills and liquids.</li> </ul> <h5>Onset Times</h5> <ul> <li>Dermal - 1 action turn</li> <li>Inhalation - Immediate</li> <li>Injection - 1 action turn</li> <li>Oral - 15 minutes</li> </ul> <h4>Effects</h4> <p>If you are exposed to a drug or toxin via its method of application — for example, you pop a pill, slap on a dermal patch, are soaked with a splash grenade, breathe in gas, or get stabbed with a coated weapon — then you are automatically subject to the substance’s effects. The duration determines how long they last.</p><p> There is no resistance test to ignore a drug or toxin’s effects, but some may call for an aptitude check to determine the effect severity. Defensive Ware: Toxin ﬁlters ▶323 allow a SOM Check to ignore a biochem drug or toxin’s effects outright (they have no effect on nanodrugs or nanotoxins). If an effect calls for an aptitude check, toxin filters apply a +30 modifier. Both toxin filters and medichines will reduce the effects of a biochem drug or toxin (damage, modifiers, etc.) and duration by half; together they nullify the effects entirely. Nanophages reduce the effects/duration of nanodrugs and nanotoxins by half.</p> <h4>Addiction and Abuse</h4> <p>If you over-use a drug, you may find yourself addicted to it. Drugs can be physically addictive (affecting the morph), mentally addictive (affecting the ego), or both. If the GM decides that you are overusing (such as more than once a day, or several times in a week), you must make a WIL Check modified by the drug’s Addiction Modifier. If you fail, you acquire the Addiction Addiction (Level 1) negative trait ▶76. Once addicted, you must take the drug regularly (according to the trait level) or face withdrawal (-10 modifier per level).</p> <p>At the GM’s discretion, heavy or extended drug use may require you to make a WIL Check modified by the Addiction Modifier to avoid increasing your Addiction trait’s level. Drug abuse may also result in other physiological or psychological effects.</p>",

They are post-Fall society’s heroin — the drug of choice for the desperate and fucked. Petals are made in the form of nanopharmaceutical flowers, potted or with a nutrient pack attached to the stem. Plucking and swallowing the petals from the flower triggers the effects. Each flower has 1d6 + 4 petals. Multiple users may share the experience if they take the petals within 1 minute of the first one being plucked; after this all petals remaining on the flower fade to translucent white and become inert.</p><p> Petal experiences are entire scenarios in and of themselves. Some access your mesh inserts (you must enable access to your implants voluntarily; if not, the drug has no effect other than low-intensity LSD-like visual hallucinations), take control of your entoptic displays, link to secretive mesh servers and other trippers, and invade your sensorium with AR “hallucinations.” Others put you into a near-comatose state during which you go on a head trip. Normally there is a well-developed theme or plot to a petal experience, though others are just streams of thematicallylinked images.</p><p> Though illegal and suppressed in many polities, new petals appear constantly, fueled by a persistent subculture of makers and users. Petalcrafters view their work as an art form. The best petals are lovingly designed, hauntingly beautiful experiences — or sometimes terrifying. The subculture of petal use ranges from casual users who occasionally do an easy, short-duration flower to hardcore addicts who spend any time not on petals trying to hunt down the most intense and esoteric varieties. Because petals combine custom nanobots with tailored chemical payloads and access codes to mesh servers, duplicating them using fabricators is impossible, leading to an active market of crafters, dealers, and traders.</p><p> Petals sometimes contain easter eggs and rewards, called “sweets” by petal users. Getting the sweets usually requires fulfilling certain conditions within the trip, such as correctly answering questions or reaching goals. Typical sweets include skillsofts, new clothing or product designs, and custom infomorph avatars.</p><p> On the negative side, some petal trips go bad, inflicting SV 1d10 or worse.
